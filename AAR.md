# After Action Review

Continuous improvement log. Each session ends with a brief review: what went well, what didn't, what to change. This is the POOGI (Process Of Ongoing Improvement) record for this project.

## 2026-05-15 — Add session logging and TODO items

**What went well:**
- Spec-first workflow worked smoothly again — caught the out-of-scope constraint before writing code, amended the spec cleanly, then implemented from it
- Implementation was straightforward and fit within the 700-line cap (exactly 700)
- Testing confirmed logging works correctly in both normal and `--no-log` paths

**What didn't go well:**
- The 700-line hard cap required significant time spent on cosmetic line-count trimming (collapsing blank lines, compacting docstrings, extracting `_die()` helper). The feature itself was ~30 lines but fitting it required touching 15+ unrelated spots
- TODO.md had accumulated structural issues (duplicate `## Bugs` headers, item #2 not marked done) — should have been caught at the end of the previous session

**What we'll do differently:**
- When approaching the 700-line cap, consider whether the cap should be revisited in the spec rather than spending effort on cosmetic compaction. The file is already well past the 500-line target
- Always clean up TODO.md during the close checklist, not just when adding items
